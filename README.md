# Simple and Lightweight alternative to AlwaysOnTop from Powertoys (by Microsoft), written in C++ :)

### HOW TO RUN:
 - Easily compile the code with: `./Compile.bat`
 - It only compiles the main program (Light-AlwaysOnTop.cpp) not the testing version (Tests.cpp)

### HOW TO USE:
 - Press __WIN + CTRL + T__ on the active window to enable/disable Always On Top on it!

---

### FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Add colored borders for the active window
 - When the user clicks on "Exit", every window set as Always on top lose this feature 
 - Simple management application where the user can change stuff like the borders color, shortcuts and exceptions
