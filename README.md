# Simple and lightweight alternative to AlwaysOnTop from Powertoys (by Microsoft), written in python :)

### HOW TO INSTALL:
 - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Run with: `python Simple-AlwaysOnTop.py`

### HOW TO USE:
 - Press __WIN + SHIFT + T__ on the active window to keep it in the foreground (do it again to disable the functionality)

#

### FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Colored border for the active window
 - Make it a background process
 - Simple management application where the user can change stuff like the border color, shortcuts and exceptions
 - Any ideas? :)
