# Simple and lightweight alternative to AlwaysOnTop from Powertoys (by Microsoft), written in python :)

### HOW TO INSTALL:
 - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Run with: `python Simple-AlwaysOnTop.py`

### HOW TO USE:
 - Press __WIN + SHIFT + T__ on the active window to keep it in the foreground (__turn on AlwaysOnTop mode__)
 - Press __WIN + SHIFT + Y__ on the active window to __turn off AlwaysOnTop mode__

#

### FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Add colored borders for the active window
 - Hide the application from the applications bar
 - Simple management application where the user can change stuff like the border color, shortcuts and exceptions
 - Any ideas? :)

#

### IDEA FOR THE 1.2 VERSION:
**The main idea is to obtain a single file which opens an icon in the traybar when executed. When clicked this icon will give two possibilities:**
 - Exit
 - Open Tool Manager\n
**The tool manager will allow you to modify the configuration, giving you the possibility to create exceptions, change the border color and other stuff**
