# Simple and lightweight alternative to AlwaysOnTop from Powertoys (by Microsoft), written in C++ :)

### HOW TO RUN:
 - Compile and run the code with: `./compile-run"`
 - NB: it compiles and run the main program (simple-AlwaysOnTop.cpp) not the testing version

### HOW TO USE:
 - Press __WIN + SHIFT + T__ on the active window to keep it in the foreground (__turn on AlwaysOnTop mode__)
 - Press __WIN + SHIFT + Y__ on the active window to __turn off AlwaysOnTop mode__

#

### FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Add colored borders for the active window
 - Hide the application from the applications bar (do not open the terminal
 - Simple management application where the user can change stuff like the border color, shortcuts and exceptions
 - Any ideas? :)

#

### IDEAS FOR THE 1.2 VERSION:
**The main idea is to obtain a single file which opens an icon in the traybar when executed. When clicked this icon will give two possibilities:**
 - Exit
 - Open Tool Manager

**The tool manager will allow you to modify the configuration, giving you the possibility to create exceptions, change the border color and other stuff**
