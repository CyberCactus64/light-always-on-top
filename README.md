# simple-always-on-top
## Simple and lightweight alternative to AlwaysOnTop from Powertoys (by Microsoft), written in python :)
- Press WIN + SHIFT + T on the active window to keep it on top (do it again to disable the functionality)

# TO INSTALL DEPENDECIES: pip install -r requirements.txt
# RUN WITH: python Simple-AlwaysOnTop.py

## FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Colored border for the active window
 - Make it a background process
 - Simple management application where can be modified stuff like the border color, shortcuts and exceptions
 - Any ideas? :)
