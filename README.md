## simple-always-on-top
# Simple and lightweight alternative to AlwaysOnTop from Powertoys (by Microsoft), written in python :)
- Press WIN + CTRL + A on the active window to keep it on top (do it again to disable the functionality)


# FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Colored border for the active window
 - Simple management application where can be modified stuff like the border color, shortcuts and exceptions
 - Any ideas? :)
