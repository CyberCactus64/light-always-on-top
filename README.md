 - Press __WIN + CTRL + T__ on the active window to keep it in the foreground (__turn on AlwaysOnTop mode__)
 - Press __WIN + CTRL + Y__ on the active window to __turn off AlwaysOnTop mode__

 - Add colored borders for the active window
 - Simple management application where the user can change stuff like the borders color, shortcuts and exceptions
